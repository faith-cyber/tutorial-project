          For the Stock: In a medium pot, combine beef, onion, crayfish, salt,
          pepper, and 6 1/2 cups water<br />
          and bring to a boil. Lower heat to maintain a simmer and cook until
          the stock is slightly reduced<br />
          and the beef is mostly tender, about 45 minutes (the beef will
          tenderize further when cooked in the soup).<br />
          Using a slotted spoon, remove beef and transfer to a medium heatproof
          bowl; set aside. Reserve stock<br />
          (you should have about 5 1/2 cups).
